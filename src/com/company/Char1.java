But java uses the Unicode system not the ASCII code system and to represent Unicode system 8 bit
is not enough to represent all characters so java uses 2 bytes for characters.
Unicode defines a fully international character set that can represent most of the worldâ€™s written languages.
It is a unification of dozens of character sets, such as Latin, Greeks, Cyrillic, Katakana, Arabic, and many more.
